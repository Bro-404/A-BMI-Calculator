# A-BMI-Calculator

Here’s an explanation of how the calculate_bmi function works:


Retrieve User Input:

The function gets the weight and height entered by the user from the input fields.
The weight is converted to a float.
The height is also converted to a float and then divided by 100 to convert it from centimeters to meters.



Calculate BMI:

The BMI is calculated using the formula:BMI = Weight​/Height**2




Display Result:

The calculated BMI is displayed in a label.
Based on the BMI value, a message box shows whether the user is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.
If the input values are not valid numbers, an error message is shown.
